### Changing the color:

I used svelte to build the UI so that mean you can't change everything on ui side, except for the color, I've used global variable on css, so it may make it easier.

You can use [unminify](https://www.unminify2.com/), to unminify the css. After that don't forget to [minify ](https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier)it again :slight\_smile:.
